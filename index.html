        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a manufacturing engineer currently working as a galvanizing production controller, 
            responsible for overseeing the corrosion-resistant coating process of steel using Zinc (Hot Dip Galvanizing)
            to produce galvanized products that meet the required standards. To achieve this, 
            I have obtained a Galvanizing Inspector certification, which ensures that every aspect of the Hot Dip Galvanizing process
            adheres to the standards, guaranteeing that the end product meets the customer's erxpectations.</p>

            <p>During my 6 years as a Galvanizing Production Controller at PT. Bukaka Teknik Utama, Indonesia. I have worked on various national and international projects, 
            including the MBZ Elevated Toll Road Steel Girder Project and the Costa Rican Steel Bridge Project. 
            <p>It is always enjoyable to hear new perspectives. Feel free to reach out to me to talk about anti-corrosion coating for steel using Zinc.</p><hr>
